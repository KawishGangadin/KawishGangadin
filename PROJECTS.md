## 🗺️ Interactive Model Viewer

During my third-year internship I developed an interactive model viewer for Soltegro, a company in Capelle aan den IJssel.
The viewer uses an SVG model of infrastructure, such as a lock chamber. Users can zoom, drag the map and click on elements to quickly get insight into what they are looking at.
For each clickable element, a foldable side panel shows the description, design decisions and all relevant information. This reduces the need to dig through nested design documents and gives insights with a single click.
I also built a workflow for uploading new models. Uploaded SVGs are validated and, if correct, automatically loaded into the application. This means developers are no longer needed to manually update models in the codebase.
